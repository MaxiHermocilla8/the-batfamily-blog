<h3>Patient Special Cell</h3>
<img height="400px" width="320px" src="../img/img_arkham/killer_croc.jpg" class="img_izq">
<p>
    <b> Real name:</b>   <br>
    <b>Profession:</b>   <br>
    <b>City:</b>   <br> 
    <b>Height:</b>     <br>
    <b>Weight:</b>   <br> 
    <b>First apparition:</b>) <br>
</p>
<p>Waylon was born with an extreme case of hyperkeratosis complicated by ichthyosis, two skin diseases at the genetic level that cause (respectively) an excessive thickening of the outer layer of the skin, and a severe loss of fatty proteins in the epidermis, which dries and cracks forming scale-like sores and calluses. <br>
    Waylon was never inherently evil, but grew up as a troublesome child due to the fights he was involved in with those who made fun of him. It was thus that his ability in street fighting grew, spending almost half of his childhood in juvenile corrections, where he learned bad arts from other inmates. <br> 
    Being alone, frustrated and full of hatred, he then has an epiphany: he was always accused of being a monster and an animal, and he was punished when he tried to defend himself by proving otherwise. After a "simple" murder in prison, he became respected and feared. That led him to consider the idea that if he could not win people's affections with his kindness, he would win their fear and respect with his strength and savagery. <br> 
    Es así como Killer Croc decide dedicarse al crimen, ya sea como guardaespaldas o sicario de algunos mafiosos, o bien formando su propia pandilla para realizar asaltos, lo que irremediablemente lo llevó a cruzarse con Batman.</p>
